# DI725 Project â€“ Image Captioning with PaliGemma

This project explores improving image captioning performance on the RISC dataset using the PaliGemma vision-language model. We investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques and domain-specific enhancements. All experiments and results are tracked with W&B (https://wandb.ai/utkuden-metu-middle-east-technical-university/project/reports/DI-725-Project-Phase-1---VmlldzoxMjM3ODcyMg?accessToken=fz7ubpe9m4i2yw8kbb51dofr0z6v829n4v4xvi6omg5c59zgwn2dq5m8r4ezmifk) and versioned on GitHub.
