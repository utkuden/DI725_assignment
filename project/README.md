# DI725 Project â€“ Image Captioning with PaliGemma

This project explores improving image captioning performance on the RISC dataset using the PaliGemma vision-language model. We investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques and domain-specific enhancements. All experiments and results are tracked with ([W&B](https://api.wandb.ai/links/utkuden-metu-middle-east-technical-university/uppa9jz5)) and versioned on GitHub.
