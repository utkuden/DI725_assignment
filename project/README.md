# DI725 Project â€“ Image Captioning with PaliGemma

This project explores improving image captioning performance on the RISC dataset using the PaliGemma vision-language model. We investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques and domain-specific enhancements. All experiments and results are tracked with ([W&B](https://api.wandb.ai/links/utkuden-metu-middle-east-technical-university/uppa9jz5)) and versioned on GitHub. Models can be found in ([HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/utkuden)).

If a problem occurs while viewing the final jupyter notebook, the following ([Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NoFYq1yyIaQuQCpX9gWeJ4Ywit2k5o08?usp=sharing)) can be used to check the code with outputs and training logs.
